Machine learning (ML) based surrogate models have become an increasingly common tool to overcome the relative expense of density functional theory in the field of computational materials discovery.
%
The application of ML surrogate models trained on expansive data sets of ab-initio DFT data has been used to discover new materials in the vast composition-space.
%
However, surrogate model applications to the structural space of bulk-crystals, \latin{i.e.} polymorphs,
are very scarce due to the inherent bias of ab-initio datasets towards systems with a large variety in composition but with limited structural diversity. 
%
Herein, we report on an active learning (AL) ML methodology that searches for the most stable crystal structures of \IrOtwo and \IrOthree by utilizing surrogate models which optimize within a candidate data set of crystal motifs sourced from publicly available materials databases.
% NUMBER
We demonstrate the efficacy of this AL-accelerated methodology by discovering 70 percent of the 10 most stable crystal structures for \IrOtwo and \IrOthree with less than 50 DFT calculations.
% NUMBER
For \IrOtwo, we reaffirm that the rutile phase is the globally stable polymorph,
while for the previously unexplored \IrOthree more than 
{\bf XX}%this needs to be filled ASAP. We have the results 
unique structures are discovered within the metastability limit of 0.2 eV per atom.
%
% There are 10 IrO3 polymorphs within 0.2 eV/atom of the lowest structure and 5 IrO3 polymorphs within 0.1 eV/atom of the lowest structure
% Of these 10, how many were unknown? Maybe 8ish? TODO double check
% NUMBER
For \IrOthree, we discover 10 previously unknown polymorphs, and the most stable 
$\alpha$-AlF\textsubscript{3} type and a rutile-like \IrOthree structure with stabilities lower than 0.2 per atom than anything known to date. 
% Add in result of new phase of IrO3 that has implications to OER chemistries (@Raul)
%
These results lead to a revised bulk Pourbaix diagram of the Ir-H\textsubscript{2}O system, showing the \IrOthree as the dominant phase under acidic oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) conditions.
%
We computationally test the proficiency of these phases towards OER and find that the above stable \IrOthree polymorphs have also much higher activity that any \IrOtwo, which can be understood from weaker bonding of the intermediates on \IrOthree surfaces.   
%
This work opens up an opportunity to structural discovery of materials and catalysts on unprecedented scale.
