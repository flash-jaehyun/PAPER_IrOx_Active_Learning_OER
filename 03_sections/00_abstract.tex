\noindent The discovery of high-performing and stable materials for sustainable energy applications is a pressing goal in catalysis and materials science.
%
Understanding the relationship between a material's structure and functionality is an important step in the process, such that viable polymorphs for a given chemical composition need to be identified.
%
Machine-learning based surrogate models have the potential to accelerate the search for polymorphs that target specific applications.
%
Herein, we report a readily generalizable active-learning (AL) accelerated algorithm for identification of electrochemically stable Iridium-oxide polymorphs of \IrOtwo and \IrOthree.
%
The search is coupled to a subsequent analysis of the electrochemical stability of the discovered structures for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
%
The algorithm starts from all known AB$_2$ and AB$_3$ type structures (more than \num{38000}) by identifying 956 unique materials structural prototypes.
%
Next, we deploy the active-learning loop to find \num{196} \IrOtwo polymorphs within the thermodynamic synthesizability limit and reaffirm the global stability of the rutile structure.
%
We find \num{75} synthesizable \IrOthree polymorphs and report a previously unknown \ce{FeF_{3}}-type structure as the most stable, termed as \aIrOthree.
%
To test model efficiency we compared to a random search via DFT.
%
We find the AL algorithm more than doubles the rate of the discovery and acquires the most stable polymorphs in about \num{4.3} generations on average.
%
Analysis of the structural properties of discovered polymorphs reveals that octahedral local coordination environments are preferred for nearly all low energy structures.
%
Subsequent Pourbaix Ir-H$_2$O analysis shows that \aIrOthree is the globally stable solid phase under acidic OER conditions and supersedes the stability of rutile \IrOtwo.
%
Calculation of theoretical OER surface activities reveal ideal weaker binding of the OER intermediates on \aIrOthree than on any other considered Iridium-oxide.
%
The proposed AL algorithm is easily generalizable to search for any binary metal-oxide structure with a predetermined stoichiometry.





%| - MY OLD VERSION
% %
% Machine learning (ML) based surrogate models have become an increasingly common tool in the field computational materials discovery to overcome the relative expense of \latin{ab-initio} density functional theory (DFT).
% %
% Training such models on expansive DFT data sets has been used to discover new materials in the vast space of material compositions.
% %
% % COMBAK This is probably too strong
% However, surrogate model applications to the structural space of bulk crystals, \latin{i.e.} polymorphs, remain relatively unexplored.
% %
% Herein, we report on an active learning (AL) framework that searches for the most stable polymorph of a chemical space by utilizing a surrogate model which is sequentially updated on the fly with generated DFT data.
% %
% The model searches within a candidate data set of crystal motifs sourced from publicly available materials databases.
% %
% We demonstrate the efficacy of this AL-accelerated methodology by discovering the most stable polymorphs of \IrOtwo and \IrOthree within the candidate space with DFT calculations of only a fraction of the candidate space.
% % 7 out of the 10 most stable crystal structures for \IrOtwo and \IrOthree with less than 50 DFT calculations.
% %
% % COMBAK TODO Update number of unique polymorphs discovered to something more meaningful
% % Let's report how many meta-stable IrO2/3 we discovered, much better than how it is currently phrased
% For \IrOtwo, we reaffirm the rutile phase as the globally stable polymorph, while also finding \mytilde200 polymorphs that are within the synthesizability limit.
% %
% For \IrOthree we discovered ~70 unique metastable polymorphs, with \mytilde20 that are more stable than anything previously reported.
% %
% The globally stable polymorph of \IrOthree is a FeF\textsubscript{3} structure type polymorph with a space group number of 167.
% %
% % There are 10 IrO3 polymorphs within 0.2 eV/atom of the lowest structure and 5 IrO3 polymorphs within 0.1 eV/atom of the lowest structure
% % Of these 10, how many were unknown? Maybe 8ish? TODO double check
% %
% %For \IrOthree, we discover 10 previously unknown polymorphs, and the most stable
% %$\alpha$-AlF\textsubscript{3} type and a rutile-like \IrOthree structure with stabilities lower than 0.2 per atom than anything known to date.
% %
% Based on the above results, we constructed a revised bulk Pourbaix diagram of the Ir-H\textsubscript{2}O system by including \IrOthree, and show that our \aIrOthree phase is the dominant and fully stable phase under acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions.
% %
% % COMBAK "the OER" or just "OER"
% Using a thermodynamic criteria for the activity towards the OER we find that the above stable \IrOthree polymorphs have significantly lower theoretical overpotentials than the rutile \IrOtwo phase.
% %
% This elevated catalytic activity is due to the weaker and more ideal binding of the OER intermediates on the more oxidized \IrOthree surfaces.
% %
% % TODO Less cheesy closing thoughts
% This work opens up the possibility of drastically accelerating the discovery of novel crystal structure motifs and has implications towards high through-put catalyst discovery efforts.
