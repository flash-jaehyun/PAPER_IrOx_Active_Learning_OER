% Structural analysis of IrO2 and IrO3 oxides %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Important Points:
%   * A good candidate set is a set of materials that have a large degree of 'structural diversity'
%
%   * We can make an analogy between the shape of these plots and typical van-der Waals curves
%     * I would argue that the tails are much less steep than a van-der Waals curve because in most cases the there is still a large degree of bonding
%       * Essentially these systems can create more and more 'porous' structures as the density is decreases, which allows us to get really large porous structures
%         * A good point can be made here that these types of systems could be useful for battery applications
%           * Pores are good in this context I think?
%
%
%   * The main coordination environments are 6 and 4-fold coordinated (Ir-O4/6 units)
%     * This is consistent with crystal field theory, or literature, etc.
%     * 6/4-coord accounts for TEMP percent of the IrO2/3 candidate space
%       * TODO Get these numbers
%     * There are in addition to 6/4-coord, a lot of other types of coordination environments
%       * A lot of these are simply weird, aphysical structures for sure
%         * Unassociated oxygens
%           * Singly-associated (part of N-hedra)
%           * Completely un-unassociated O atoms, just randomly placed in unit cell
%
%         * Especially at the extreme ends of the average coord metric
%       * But there are also a lot of legitimate coordination environments
%         * I've manually parsed the dataset and found
%
%   * There is a lot to say about the different kinds of 100% corner sharing octahedral IrO3 systems
%     * There are a lot of these systems that differ in subtle ways
%       * Basically octahedra can be "rotated" in different directions, making them distinct
%
%   * Interesting types of systems
%     * Layered systems (A lot of variety here)
%     * Cubic coordination environments (A few cool looking examples)
%     * New coordination environments
%       * TODO Remind myself again of these
%
%   * IrO2 has more 4-fold coordinated systems than IrO3
%     * Makes sense, the more oxygens you have the more oxygen-rich motifs are favored
%   * IrO2 has large "dip" in the EvsV "convex hull" while IrO3 has a much more shallow increase in energy as you move to the right from the most stable polymorph
%     * This is probably due to the fact that IrO3 can create more porous layered structures
%
% NOTES:
%   * Describe convex hull, classes of structures (\ce{$\alpha$-AlF3} like, rutile like, and layered, should be segregated in hull plot)
%   * Describe structures within each class, cite lit where appropriate

% | - Paragraph start
% There should be a paragraph which discussed the structural drift and performance/acceleration in more detail
% I would use the updated version of Figure 2c.
%
Next, we describe the structural variety that is present in our data set of \mytilde\num{1000} \IrOtwo and \IrOthree polymorphs.
%
% Looks like I wasn't using the algorithm implemented in R52 (David Waroquiers)
The coordination environment package ChemEnv, developed by Waroquiers et. al. \cite{Waroquiers2017} and implemented in pymatgen \cite{Ong2013}, was used to assign M-O crystal filed coordination types (e.g. octahedral, square pyramidal, cubic, etc.) to each of the \mytilde one thousand structures in our combined data set.
%
{\bf Describe in two paragraphs what is shown in Figure 3 and in what the main consequences of these results}
%
% Not true anymore?
Additional esoteric coordination environments were identified manually, see SI.
%
The resulting distribution is included in Figure \ref{fig:E_vs_V}, which plots the formation enthalpy and volume, both normalized on a per atom basis.

% See SI for additional panels at intermediate iterations of the active learning algorithm.
% The Gibbs formation energy (either DFT derived or predicted from the GP model) and associated GP estimated error (2 sigmas or something TEMP) is plotted for each polymorph in the \IrOtwo candidate space.
% The data points in each subset are ordered from most to least stable (lowest to largest DE formation).
% The individual markers are colored based on their ordering in the final converged GP model.
% Acquired structures are identified by their red borders and slightly larger size.
% The insets show the most stable TEMP structures, where several well known crystal structures are labeled.
