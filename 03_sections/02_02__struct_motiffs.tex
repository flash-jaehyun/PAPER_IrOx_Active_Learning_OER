% | - Paragraph start
% There should be a paragraph which discussed the structural drift and performance/acceleration in more detail
% I would use the updated version of Figure 2c.
%
Next, we describe the structural variety that is present in our data set of \mytilde\num{1000} \IrOtwo and \IrOthree polymorphs.
% Looks like I wasn't using the algorithm implemented in R52 (David Waroquiers)
The coordination environment package ChemEnv, developed by Waroquiers et. al. \cite{Waroquiers2017} and implemented in pymatgen \cite{Ong2013}, was used to assign M-O crystal filed coordination types (e.g. octahedral, square pyramidal, cubic, etc.) to each of the \mytilde one thousand structures in our combined data set.
%
{\bf Describe in two paragraphs what is shown in Figure 3 and in what the main consequences of these results}
%
% Not true anymore?
Additional esoteric coordination environments were identified manually, see SI.
% COMBAK What normalization method do I end up using for the E and V?
The resulting distribution is included in Figure \ref{fig:E_vs_V}, which plots the electronic energy and volume, both normalized on a per atom basis.

% Gaussian process machine learning models trained initially on (a) publicly available DFT data for \IrOtwo and (b) all of the acquired DFT calculations from the active learning algorithm.
% See SI for additional panels at intermediate iterations of the active learning algorithm.
% The Gibbs formation energy (either DFT derived or predicted from the GP model) and associated GP estimated error (2 sigmas or something TEMP) is plotted for each polymorph in the \IrOtwo candidate space.
% The data points in each subset are ordered from most to least stable (lowest to largest DE formation).
% The individual markers are colored based on their ordering in the final converged GP model.
% Acquired structures are identified by their red borders and slightly larger size.
% The insets show the most stable TEMP structures, where several well known crystal structures are labeled.
