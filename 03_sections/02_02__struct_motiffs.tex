% Structural analysis of IrO2 and IrO3 oxides %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Important Points:
%   * A good candidate set is a set of materials that have a large degree of 'structural diversity'
%
%   * We can make an analogy between the shape of these plots and typical van-der Waals curves
%     * I would argue that the tails are much less steep than a van-der Waals curve because in most cases the there is still a large degree of bonding
%       * Essentially these systems can create more and more 'porous' structures as the density is decreases, which allows us to get really large porous structures
%         * A good point can be made here that these types of systems could be useful for battery applications
%           * Pores are good in this context I think?
%
%
%   * The main coordination environments are 6 and 4-fold coordinated (Ir-O4/6 units)
%     * This is consistent with crystal field theory, or literature, etc.
%     * 6/4-coord accounts for TEMP percent of the IrO2/3 candidate space
%       * TODO Get these numbers
%     * There are in addition to 6/4-coord, a lot of other types of coordination environments
%       * A lot of these are simply weird, aphysical structures for sure
%         * Unassociated oxygens
%           * Singly-associated (part of N-hedra)
%           * Completely un-unassociated O atoms, just randomly placed in unit cell
%
%         * Especially at the extreme ends of the average coord metric
%       * But there are also a lot of legitimate coordination environments
%         * I've manually parsed the dataset and found
%
%   * There is a lot to say about the different kinds of 100% corner sharing octahedral IrO3 systems
%     * There are a lot of these systems that differ in subtle ways
%       * Basically octahedra can be "rotated" in different directions, making them distinct
%
%   * Interesting types of systems
%     * Layered systems (A lot of variety here)
%     * Cubic coordination environments (A few cool looking examples)
%     * New coordination environments
%       * TODO Remind myself again of these
%
%   * IrO2 has more 4-fold coordinated systems than IrO3
%     * Makes sense, the more oxygens you have the more oxygen-rich motifs are favored
%   * IrO2 has large "dip" in the EvsV "convex hull" while IrO3 has a much more shallow increase in energy as you move to the right from the most stable polymorph
%     * This is probably due to the fact that IrO3 can create more porous layered structures
%
% NOTES:
%   * Describe convex hull, classes of structures (\ce{$\alpha$-AlF3} like, rutile like, and layered, should be segregated in hull plot)
%   * Describe structures within each class, cite lit where appropriate

We next explored the structural diversity of the 448 \IrOtwo and 258 \IrOthree unique polymorphs in our candidate set.
Here, a large variety in structure densities and coordination environments is desirable, since this will enable us to discover novel systems.
Figure \ref{fig:E_vs_V} a) and b) report the relation between the enthalpy of formation and the inverse atomic density (Volume/atom) for \IrOtwo and \IrOthree structures, respectively.
The metastablilty limit of ?? and ?? \textbf{you need to explain what this means, that they were computed using a previously reported algorithm (cite Murat's paper) and point to an SI section with the values.  is not clear where in the figure this is. Raul can you add this part?} for \IrOtwo and \IrOthree respectively is shown as horizontal lines in the plot insets, where XX and XX polymorphs for \IrOtwo and \IrOthree respectively are found to be under the meta-stability line, and are therefore predicted to be  meta-stable.

We note that for both compositions, densities vary widely from \textbf{XYZ} to \textbf{XYZ}, such that both low volume (dense) and high volume (porous) structures are contained in our candidate set.

As expected \textbf{why do you expect this?}, the most stable systems are found at low volume\textbf{can we change this to ``at the low end of the volume range (xyz to xyz)''}, where the shape of envelope curve (lowest energy for a given volume) is analogous to the shape of the Lennard-Jones potential\textbf{is this important or expected?}.
However, for \IrOthree in particular, the correlation between energy and volume is less pronounced, where highly porous structure are found to be meta-stable\textbf{unclear what you mean in the last part of this sentence}. (We note that the stability of highly porous systems has a tendency to be overestimated on the DFT+GGA level, where van der Walls interactions should be included for a better description). \textbf{unclear what you mean here, vdw is attractive so shouldn't it just make them more stable?}

We classified the structures with respect to the Ir-O coordination environment (such as octahedral, square pyramidal, tetrahedral, cubic, etc.), by using the chemEnv package, developed by Waroquiers et. al. \cite{Waroquiers2017} and implemented in pymatgen \cite{Ong2013}. Although the dataset contains  coordination environments ranging from \textbf{xyz to xyz}, structures with a coordination number of 6 (octahedreal) or 4 (tetrahedreal) are the most prevalent and are highlighted in blue and red respectively in Figure \ref{fig:E_vs_V} a) and b). For both \IrOtwo and \IrOthree the most stable candidates are seen to have an octahedreal oxygen coordination\textbf{this is kind of vague, do you mean the most stable or most of the most stable?} , which is generally favored by many other metal oxides. \cite{Waroquiers2017} The arrangement of the octahedreal units, which are connected through either corner- or edge-sharing, can furthermore be used to classify the structures, that typically has a combination of the two. \textbf{I don't understand the end of this sentence.  Give some information of how this applies to your structures.}

Figure \ref{fig:E_vs_V} c) and d) report a selection of meta-stable structures for \IrOtwo and \IrOthree, respectively. For \IrOtwo, rutile is the most stable, in correspondence with experiment \cite{}\textbf{what experiments?  is this  heats of formation?}. Also, several of the well-known\textbf{experimentally?  it is not clear here if you mean just the geometries or that these materials have been reported in the expt. literature} crystal structures, including  columbite, purite, brookite and anatase (not all shown) are computed to be meta-stable.
Figure \ref{} reports the five most stable \IrOthree structures, corresponding to labels (1)-(5) in Figure \ref{fig:E_vs_V} b). However, we have identified several additional meta-stable structures, including 2D(i), highly porous(iii) and 1D(v) polymorphs, which could be interesting for battery applications\textbf{why?} \cite{}. We note that\textbf{try not to use ``we note that", it is generally always better to motivate why you are noting that} the Cmcm polymorph in d) iv. is currently the lowest energy structure on Materials Project (cite https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-1097041/) \cite{} \textbf{the labeling scheme jumping between two figures is a little confusing here, and it obfuscates the point I think you are trying to make in this last sentence}.




% Additional esoteric coordination environments were identified manually, see SI.
%
%The resulting distribution is included in Figure \ref{fig:E_vs_V}, which plots the formation enthalpy and volume, both normalized on a per atom basis. \textbf{this section needs to be fleshed out still and connections made between discovered structures and the literature, this seems like the place in the document that needs the most work}\\
