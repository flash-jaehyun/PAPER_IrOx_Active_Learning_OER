%
% OUTLINE:
%  * Solving for crystal structures in a generally difficult problem
%  * It's an important problem to solve because all chemical/physical properties of a material are fundamentally linked to the atomic structure.
%  * Although we've seen a lot of work in the past ~10 years from material science groups leveraging recent advances in big-data, ML, cheaper computational resources, high-throughput screening, materials databases, etc.
%    * Most of the focus has been on exploring compositions and not structure

% TODO this intro sentence will be a reference dump for literature in crystal structure prediction
To understand or simulate the properties of novel polymorphs of functional materials their crystal structure must first be solved for,
which remains a challenging problem in materials science.
\cite{Woodley2008,Graser2018}
%
Large high-throughput ab-initio datasets
\cite{Saal2013,Jain2013,Curtarolo2012, mamun2019high}
have enabled approaching many problems in materials research with machine-learning,
\cite{Kirklin2015}
but these datasets are systematically biased towards known materials or hypothetical materials derived from common crystal prototypes.
%
As such, there is a need for enabling the systematic exploration of structural diversity at target compositions to be able to quantitatively relate computational predictions with experimental measurements in materials applications.

% TODO All global optimization papers go here
% TODO Add review paper for GO
Common contemporary approaches to inorganic crystal structure prediction involve a variety of different strategies of exploring the high-dimensional potential energy landscape to find local or global minima,
with methods ranging from simulated annealing to evolutionary algorithms to particle swarm optimization
\cite{Oganov2006,Lyakhov2010,Glass2006,Wang2012,Pickard2011,Pickard2006,Avery2019,Lonie2011}
%
% TODO Find solid example of shortcomings of classical GO schemes
These approaches provide comprehensive,
and often successful searches for stable polymorphs but tend to hit a tractability wall with increasing system size as the number of polymorphic configurations increases exponentially with the number and types of elements considered~\cite{Stillinger1999}.
%
As such, there is a need for crystal structure prediction algorithms that are as generalizable as previously reported methods while reducing the computational cost associated with uncovering new novel polymorphic phases.

Active learning (AL) frameworks in conjunction with surrogate models have emerged as an effective approach to successfully speed up various problems in materials science,
and hence have the potential to deliver an efficient alternative and complimentary approach to established crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods.

There have been numerous recent efforts in developing unique approaches to materials discovery,
including a tight-binding model utilizing genetic algorithms~\cite{VanDenBossche2018},
agent-based rapid generation of phase diagrams in diverse chemistries~\cite{Montoya2020},
and an image-based materials representation procedure from Noh \latin{et al.}~\cite{noh2019inverse},
which was used to find stable vanadium oxide polymorphs.

% | - PARAGRAPH BODY
%
Here we report on a rapid crystal structure discovery approach that leverages machine learning surrogate models and an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of polymorphs at target chemical compositions.
% ,and show specific applications in two important \IrOx compositions (x=2 and 3) relevant for electrocatalyst applications.
%
Our method does not rely on the existence of past DFT data,
but instead sequentially generates the minimum sized data set to effectively search within a structurally diverse space of candidate structures generated from crystal structure prototypes.
%
%The algorithm avoids operating in the structural space by leveraging nature's propensity for symmetry by preparing data sets with a large degree of structural diversity at fixed composition.
% this sounds little hand waving | RF Maybe it needs more exposition, I'm convoluting 2 points here, that we don't do traditional GO opt. in cont. PES and that we use the intuition of symmetry to our advantage
%
%As an alternative approach to GO,
% We first define a set of structurally diverse candidate crystal polymorphs, and secondly, search through the static list of candidates with a selection-type algorithm.
%
%This approach relies on being able to prepare candidate structures that are physically reasonable and likely low in energy.
%
%To date, there have been various techniques to prepare candidate structures, including generating structures randomly, enumerating space groups, etc. \textbf{Refs?}
%
% This looks  out of space. Consider moving up or eliminate. Also, this is more a discussion statement.
%
% Empirically, we know that nature tends to favor symmetric structures, and so we will leverage this intuition by building a dataset explicitly enumerating through space groups.
%
% TODO COMBAK Battery applications?
We demonstrate the application of this methodology in the space of iridium oxide polymorphs,
an important class of materials with applications in electrochemistry,
but with unresolved structure-activity properties critical for understanding their catalytic activity.
%
% See following link for list of important IrO2 OER papers:
% https://workflowy.com/#/e755141e2f66
In particular, Rutile-\ce{IrO_2} (\rIrOtwo) (\ce{Ir^{4+}} oxidation state), the most stable form of iridium-oxide at standard conditions,
is a well-studied electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

%
% \textbf{Need refer to the Schloegl work in this section}
% Which Schloegl papers are you all referring to?
Previous studies on a SrIrO\textsubscript{3} OER electrocatalyst demonstrated that Sr leaching might leave behind a highly oxidized \ce{Ir^{6+}} species which was argued to be responsible for the observed OER activity.
\cite{Seitz2016}

In the remainder of this paper, we first outline the generation of our candidate structures for \IrOtwo and \IrOthree and introduce the AL accelerated surrogate model.
%
Next, we demonstrate the application of our AL scheme to the \IrOtwo and \IrOthree prototype spaces and show the performance of our routine at finding the most stable polymorphs in the candidate sets.
%
Next, we analyze the crystallographic structural motifs of the DFT relaxed structures and discuss the trends between the most stable polymorphs.
%
Lastly, we construct a revised bulk Pourbaix diagram of the Ir-H$_2$O systems, and evaluate the OER performance for the most stable phases.
%
%highlighting the importance of the \IrOthree phases under OER.
