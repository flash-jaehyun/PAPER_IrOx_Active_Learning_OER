Iterative Active Machine Learning and unique prototype identification to discover stable new materials and catalysts.
Motivation for \ce{IrO_x}, low representation, longstanding controversy over oxidation states and topology, and demonstrates promise for OER and Li ion batteries.

% ################################# Paragraph #################################
Reported +6 oxidation state phases are achievable leading to high degree of structural variability, which is the highest for transition metals.
High oxidation states (low pH high anodic voltage, harsh oxidizing conditions) unexplored, need very specific structures with precise oxygen connectivity (aka high pressure \ce{SrIrO_3}) that can exist.
Machine learning is the efficient way to explore this “exploring Antarctica for life” sparse space.
What we show here...

% ################################# Paragraph #################################
The two key features of our algorithm that make the exploration of an expansive space possible are its use of surrogate models and active learning framework.
Because DFT calculations are prohibitively computationally expensive to carry out for large data sets, herein we train a Gaussian Process (GP) machine learning model to serve as a surrogate model.
In general active learning applications, the requisite training data is not available.
Active learning frameworks are a means by which to generate the most valuable training data set, on the fly.
