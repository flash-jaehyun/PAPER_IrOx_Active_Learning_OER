% Setting up the general problem of crystal structure determination
% Very hard to exhaustively sample all structures,
% therefore it's hard to know if you are considering the global minimum structure
% All important properties of a material are governed by structure
% (assuming stoich is known)
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% | - Paragraph start
Predicting the thermodynamically stable crystal structures for an arbitrary inorganic system remains a challenging problem in computational material science.
%
Experimentally synthesized inorganic materials often conform to the global minimum energy structure (or similarly stable meta-stable phases). When simulations are used to guide the search  for new materials, the stable and meta-stable crystal structures must be known in order to predict the material properties.
%therefore it is desirable from a computational perspective to know the corresponding crystal structure to conduct simulations on.
%
This problem is theoretically challenging for all but the most simple systems systems such as mono/bi-metallic materials which tend to adopt simple close-packed arrangements.
%
For all other systems though, the structural variety available is practically uncountable.


This is particularly true for metal-oxides, a diverse and important class of materials, which tend to organize themselves into well-defined coordination environment motifs such as octahedral and tetrahedral units (short-range order).
%
These basic building blocks can then be connected through 3 primary modes, vertex-sharing, edge-sharing, and face-sharing configurations (mid-range order) which can give rise to long-range order by forming porous or layered systems.
% Other classical crystal structure finding methods here
The potential to form structures with different arrangements on multiple length-scales gives oxides a large degree of structural variety which it turn makes the space of possible polymorphs intractably large for traditional methods like simulated annealing, TEMP, or TEMP.
% TEMP
In order to navigate this vast space of materials, Machine Learning approaches has a huge potential to guide the search for structures of interest, and by-passing the need for expensive computations for all possible arrangements. 

Iterative Active Machine Learning and unique prototype identification to discover stable new materials and catalysts.

Motivation for \ce{IrO_x}, low representation, longstanding controversy over oxidation states and topology, and demonstrates promise for OER and Li ion batteries.

% Talk about problem w.r.t. Iridium Oxides
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% | - Paragraph start
Herein, we focus on iridium oxide chemical systems.
%
Iridium oxides are an important class of materials with applications in electrochemistry and TEMP.
%
Rutile-IrO2, the most stable form of iridium-oxide at standard conditions, is a well studied electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
% (TODO cite science paper)
Iridium in rutile-IrO2 has a [4+] formal oxidation state, but a previous studies on SrIrO3 electrocatayls  under operating conditions (low pH and high anodic voltage) demonstrated that Sr leaching left behind a highly oxidized Ir[6+] (IrO3) system that was predicted to be responsible for the observed OER activity.
%
For this reason we focused our study to search for stable polymorphs in the standard IrO2 stoicheometry  as well as higher oxidation state corresponding to IrO3.
% TODO Reference the paper(s) from a-AlF3 systems
IrO3 is a natural stoichiometry to target since it's the only one that can form octahedral units that are 100 percent corner sharing, and there is plenty of research on coordination crystals of the same stoicheometry. (TEMP reference).

%Reported +6 oxidation state phases are achievable leading to high degree of structural variability, which is the highest for transition metals.
%High oxidation states (low pH high anodic voltage, harsh oxidizing conditions) unexplored, need very specific structures with precise oxygen connectivity (aka high pressure \ce{SrIrO_3}) that can exist.
% Machine learning is the efficient way to explore this “exploring Antarctica for life” sparse space.

% Talk about the problem with optimizing in 3N cartesian space
% Best way to create a population of polymorphs is to consider symmetry
%   - nature loves symmetry
%   - Talk about other material databases
%   - They mostly explore composition space, despite this though, there does exist a lot of variety in structure

% 2  --> 3 key features (first is that we're not working in 3N space!!!)
The two key features of our algorithm that make the exploration of an expansive space possible are its use of surrogate models and active learning framework.
%
Because DFT calculations are prohibitively computationally expensive to carry out for large data sets, herein we train a Gaussian Process (GP) machine learning model to serve as a surrogate model.
%
In general active learning applications, the requisite training data is not available.
%
Active learning frameworks are a means by which to generate the most valuable training data set, on the fly.
