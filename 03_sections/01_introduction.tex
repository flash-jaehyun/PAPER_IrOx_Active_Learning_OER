% * General intro into problem, give proper context

%
% OUTLINE:
%  * Solving for crystal structures in a generally difficult problem
%  * It's an important problem to solve because all chemical/physical properties of a material are fundamentally linked to the atomic structure.
%  * Although we've seen a lot of work in the past ~10 years from material science groups leveraging recent advances in big-data, ML, cheaper computational resources, high-throughput screening, materials databases, etc.
%    * Most of the focus has been on exploring compositions and not structure

% TODO this intro sentence will be a reference dump for literature in crystal structure prediction
Predicting the thermodynamically favorable crystal structures for an arbitrary inorganic system remains a challenging problem in computational material science.\cite{Woodley2008}
%
% Experimentally synthesized inorganic materials often conform to the global minimum energy structure (or similarly stable meta-stable phases).
%
% TODO Find reference to backup the importance of knowing the crystal structure to predict properties of real-world systems. I would consider this to be common knowledge but relevant article would be nice.
To simulate the material properties of new meta-stable polymorphs, which are close in energy to the convex hull of stability, their structures must first be found. 
%When simulations are used to guide the search for new materials, the stable and meta-stable crystal structures, \latin{i.e.} polymorphs,  close to the convex hull of stability must be known in order to predict the material properties.\textbf{the previous sentence doesn't make sense, I'm not sure what you are trying to say here}
%
% Structure vs. composition enumeration (composition done to death)
% Give example of how over represented some motifs are
%
% TODO Cite multiple materials databases here
Although there have been numerous examples in recent years of machine learning algorithms applied towards the prediction of formation energies of large \latin{ab-initio} data sets,
these data sets are biased towards common structures and varying composition space.
%
For example the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) contains a large dataset of ternary-alloy combinations in the same close-packed cubic structure.\cite{Kirklin2015}
%
% Should we say that enumerating comp. is easy and struct. is hard?
As such, these efforts have been primarily concerned with the enumeration of composition (elemental identity and stoichiometries) and less so with the exploration of structural diversity.
%
% There are way more papers in the general area of GO than these
% I'm leaning away from framing as a "structural-diversity" problem with the databases and more so as a method of global optimization
% In the past, various groups have put forth methodologies to address the structural-diversity problem using computation for the MnO2~ and VOx~ polymorph spaces,
% but most of these methodologies are limited by the fact that they are operating within the highly intractable/dimensional PES.

% TODO All global optimization papers go here
% TODO Add review paper for GO
Historically, the most common approach to crystal structure prediction relied on classical global optimization (GO) schemes,
in which the local/global minimum are found via numerical optimization routines that operate within the continuous potential energy surface (PES).  %highly dimensional is also next sentence
%
% TODO Find solid example of shortcomings of classical GO schemes
These approaches, such as simulated annealing, are only tractable for the most simple systems,
such as metallic crystals which tend to adopt highly symmetric close-packed configurations.%, but is less suited for more complex materials.  % Example when it fails? RF Not off of the top of my head, it's a kind of claim that is generically true, but we should find something more concrete
%
These methods are fundamentally limited by structures with a high dimensional PES, whose degrees of freedoms (and potential number of polymorphs) rises exponentially with system size.\cite{Stillinger1999} The class of structurally diverse metal-oxides are a prime example of a chemical space for which structure prediction is non-trivial, and the materials tend to organize into well-defined local coordination environments (octahedral, tetrahedral, etc.) which assemble in a large variety of configurations with long-range order.



\textbf{We should mention genetic algorithm approaches. Include: machine-learning aided genetic algorithms for the composition of alloy nanoparticles \cite{Jennings2019} and tight-binding based genetic algorithm \cite{VanDenBossche2018}.}


\textbf{We should mention recent paper for 'inverse design machine learning approach' where they find the stable Vanadium oxide phases \cite{noh2019inverse}}

In parallel, active learning frameworks utilizing surrogate models have been demonstrated to successfully speed up ab initio calculations, including structural optimizations\cite{hansen2019atomistic}, transition-state searches \cite{torres2019low}, and fitting of inter-atomic potentials. \cite{podryabinkin2017active}
\textbf{These references don't seem very balanced. I'm sure there are other papers outside of the Norskov group we can cite here}

%
% Emphasize the candidate space generation as a KEY feature of algorithm

%To address the limitations of traditional global optimization methods,
% Not sure this is justified after VO study.

Here we report on a crystal structure discovery algorithm that leverages machine learning surrogate models and an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of novel crystal structures at fixed composition and does not rely on large sets of generated DFT data.
%
%
%The algorithm avoids operating in the structural space by leveraging nature's propensity for symmetry by preparing data sets with a large degree of structural diversity at fixed composition.  
% this sounds little hand waving | RF Maybe it needs more exposition, I'm convoluting 2 points here, that we don't do traditional GO opt. in cont. PES and that we use the intuition of symmetry to our advantage
%
%As an alternative approach to GO, 
We first define a set of structurally diverse candidate crystal polymorphs, and secondly, search through the static list of candidates with a selection-type algorithm.
%
%This approach relies on being able to prepare candidate structures that are physically reasonable and likely low in energy.
%
% TODO Find references for various ways of preparing candidate structures
%To date, there have been various techniques to prepare candidate structures, including generating structures randomly, enumerating space groups, etc. \textbf{Refs?}
%
% This looks  out of space. Consider moving up or eliminate. Also, this is more a discussion statement.

%Empirically, we know that nature tends to favor symmetric structures, and so we will leverage this intuition by building a dataset explicitly enumerating through space groups.

% Introduce specific system (Ir-oxides), relevance (OER), and what is to be
% gained by discovering new polymorphs
% | - %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We demonstrate this methodology in the space of iridium oxide polymorphs,
an important class of materials with applications in electrochemistry. \textbf{Refs?}
%
% See following link for list of important IrO2 OER papers:
% https://workflowy.com/#/e755141e2f66
In particular, \rIrOtwo (Ir[4+] oxidation state), is the most stable form  % best-known?
of iridium-oxide at standard conditions,
and is a well studied electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
\cite{Seitz2016,Lee2012a,McCrory2015,Trotochaud2012,Danilovic2014,Carmo2013,Miles1978,Beni1979}
%
Previous studies on SrIrO\textsubscript{3} electrocatalyst for the OER demonstrated that Sr leaching might leave behind a highly oxidized Ir (Ir[6+] for hypothetical \IrOthree) and it was argued as one possibly for observed high OER activity.\cite{Seitz2016}  \textbf{Need refer to the Schloegl work in this section}
%
% @Michal wants a Schlogl paper here, not sure which TODO
Other groups also observed reconstruction of \IrOx catalysts under reaction conditions and subsequent formation of an unknown structure. \cite{Pearce2017} 
%
Highly oxidized \IrOthree phases are also formed as the terminal structure of Li\textsubscript{x}IrO\textsubscript{3} anodes.\cite{Pearce2017}\textbf{more refs here}
%
% TODO Find reference for IrOxHy phases and their importance
For these reasons, we focused our study to search for stable polymorphs in the \IrOtwo stoicheometry and  oxidized \IrOthree stoicheometry.
%thereby neglecting the possibility of metal-hydroxide phases which have previously been shown to important.
%
%Purely octahedral \IrOthree leads naturally to 100\% corner sharing octahedra,
%where all terminal surface Ir-oxygens are potentially OER active sites.
%
% TODO Add references to octahedra literature
%Furthermore, such pure corner sharing octahedral crystals are known from in other systems such fluorites and chlorites.

%Reported +6 oxidation state phases are achievable leading to high degree of structural variability, which is the highest for transition metals.
%High oxidation states (low pH high anodic voltage, harsh oxidizing conditions) unexplored, need very specific structures with precise oxygen connectivity (aka high pressure \ce{SrIrO_3}) that can exist.
% Machine learning is the efficient way to explore this “exploring Antarctica for life” sparse space.

% Paragraph outlining the structure of the paper
%
% | - %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\textbf{this needs a lead in sentence that transitions from the last paragraph}
We first define our prototype space for \IrOtwo and \IrOthree structure generation and introduce the active-learning surrogate model.
%
Next, we apply AL \textbf{please fix the inconsistent acronym abbreviations throughout the document} to the \IrOtwo and \IrOthree prototype space. We explore the acceleration/performance and practical limitations of this approach, and analyze the resultant crystallographic structural information and trends for the most stable polymorphs.
%
%Here, we also extract and analyze the rich structural information of our set.
%
Lastly, we construct a revised bulk Pourbaix diagram of the Ir$_x$O$_y$ systems, and evaluate the OER performance for the most stable phases.

%highlighting the importance of the \IrOthree phases under OER.
%
%Finally, we construct thermodynamic OER volcano of most stable phases and discuss the trends in activities.

% Very hard to exhaustively sample all structures, therefore it's hard to know if you are considering the global minimum structure


% | - __old__
% By considering only systems of unique stoicheometry we leave the search space of 3N Cartesian coordinates and enter a one dimensinal search space of structurally unique candidates.
%
% Within this search space, machine learning is used to accelerate and guide the search for promising and stable structures by by-passing the need to perform expensive electronic structure calculations for the entire candidate space.
% In order to navigate this vast space of materials, Machine Learning approaches has a huge potential to guide the search for structures of interest, and by-passing the need for expensive computations for all possible arrangements.
% Motivation for \ce{IrO_x}, low representation, longstanding controversy over oxidation states and topology, and demonstrates promise for OER and Li ion batteries.
% These basic building blocks can then be connected through 3 primary modes, vertex-sharing, edge-sharing, and face-sharing configurations (mid-range order) which can give rise to long-range order by forming porous or layered systems.
% Other classical crystal structure finding methods here
% The potential to form structures with different arrangements on multiple length-scales gives oxides a large degree of structural variety which it turn makes the space of possible polymorphs intractably large for traditional methods like simulated annealing, TEMP, or TEMP.
