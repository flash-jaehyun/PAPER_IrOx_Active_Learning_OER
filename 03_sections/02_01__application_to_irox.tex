We now turn our attention of the application of this active learning scheme to the discovery of stable forms of IrO2 and IrO3.
% Comment on this line | TODO do stuff
%The AL algorithm is applied separately to IrO2 and IrO3 because we are specifically interested in the most stable polymorphs at each stoichiometry.
% TODO How many features drop out when you constrain the stoich.?
%This has an the added benefit of reducing the number of fingerprint vectors from the Voronoi tesselation dramatically (from TEMP to TEMP) because many features are senstive to changes in stoicheometry.

% Results for IrO3
% MAIN RESULTS:

% We need to call them something else than "convergence plots" (bad name)

%
Figure \ref{fig:iro2_al} a and b shows several iterations of the active learning loop for the IrO3 candidate space.
%
The figures plot the predicted (small circles) and aquired (large red-bordered circles) formation energies against the candidate space, sorted by the formation energy.
%
An acquisition bin size of 10 DFT calculations per iteration and an initial seed of 11 calculations were used.
%plots of the AL predictions on the candidate space at particular generations of the AL algorithm for the IrO3 candidate space with an aquisition bin size of 10 DFT calculations per iteration and an initial 11 calculations used for seeding.
%
Figure \ref{fig:iro2_al} a. shows the progression of the model at selected generations of the active learning loop, starting and ending with the initillay seeded generation and final generation, respectivelly.
%
As the ALL aquires more DFT calculations, the predicted uncertainty on the remaining candidate space decreases,
as evidenced by the shrinking error bars with increasing AL generation.
%
The middle panel corresponds to the converged generation of the ALL, which finished after TEMP iterations of the ALL (TEMP DFT calculations).
%
The middle panel is reproduced in figure \ref{fig:iro2_al}, which also shows the real DFT energies accompanying each predicted formation energy (hollow diamonds).
% Probably remove the diamonds and add the parity subplot?
% Figure \ref{fig:iro2_al} b. shows the formation energy, either predicted (small colored circles) or computed (large red-bordered circles), is plotted on the y-axis against all structures in the candidate space of IrO3 polymorphs.
%
It is evident from figure \ref{fig:iro2_al}, that the Gaussian process model is doing a poor job of predicting the DFT formation energy of the candidate space, with an exceptionally poor MAE of ~0.5 eV/atom at the AL generation shown here.
%
This is clearly seen in the parity plot (Fig TEMP), which shows that the predicted DFT energies become increasingly less accurate as stability of the polymorph decreases, with low stability structures tending to reconfigure into lower energy states.
%
This is significantly lower than the leave-one out cross validation error of ~0.15 eV/atom, which is performed by predicting only on optimized strctures, indicating that the issue does not lie with a poor predictive model, but instead with the large degree of structural reorganization that occurs over the course of a typical DFT ionic optimization.

Results from machine-learning accelerated active learning material discovery algorithm.
% FORMATION ENTHALPY, FIX
Both (a) and (b) plot the formation enthalpy (either predicted from the model or computed by DFT) for each system in the candidate pool, ordered by decreasing stability (low to high formation energy).
%
Formation energies predicted by the surrogate model are represented by smaller circles,
while acquired DFT formation energies are shown as enlarged red bordered circles.
%
Each data point is colored based on the ordering of the DFT formation energies, with low formation energy systems on the dark end of the spectrum and the highest formation energy species colored light.
%
Error bars representing 1 sigma standard deviation from the Gaussian Process model are shown for each prediction.
%
(a) Series of ML convergence plots at different generations of the active learning algorithm.
%
The middle panel indicates the generation which satisifies the AL stop criteria (see text)
%
(b) Expanded ML plot for the generation that satisfies the stop criteria.
%
Black diamonds indicate the actual DFT formation energy for each system.
%
Inset shows the most stable 20 systems that are within the energetic window of meta-stability (indicated by grey band).
%
(c)
Number of the top 20 polymorphs discovered as a function of the AL generation number for the AL loop using the aquisition criteria in equation TEMP and a control run that utilized a random  aquisition method.

% Gaussian process machine learning models trained initially on (a) publicly available DFT data for IrO2 and (b) all of the acquired DFT calculations from the active learning algorithm.
% See SI for additional panels at intermediate iterations of the active learning algorithm.
% The Gibbs formation energy (either DFT derived or predicted from the GP model) and associated GP estimated error (2 sigmas or something TEMP) is plotted for each polymorph in the IrO2 candidate space.
% The data points in each subset are ordered from most to least stable (lowest to largest DE formation).
% The individual markers are colored based on their ordering in the final converged GP model.
% Acquired structures are identified by their red borders and slightly larger size.
% The insets show the most stable TEMP structures, where several well known crystal structures are labeled.
