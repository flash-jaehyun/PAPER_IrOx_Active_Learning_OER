In conclusion, we have demonstrated an active-learning accelarated algorithm for the discovery of stable crystal polymorphs by searching through a candidate space of structurally distinct iridium-oxide phases.
% TODO Can I generalize this result for both IrO2 and IrO3?
% TODO Use percentage of total systems instead of just # of DFT calcs
The algorithm can identify half of the 10 percent most stable polymorphs with only TEMP DFT calculations.
%
We presented a structural coordination analysis that revealed a large degree of structural diversity in our post-DFT dataset with many common coordination motiffs present (octahedral, tetrahedral, cubic, TEMP, TEMP) as well as new novel coordination environnments (TEMP, TEMP),
although octahedral coordinations are energetically preferred.
%
In the IrO2 space our search failed to uncover anything more stable than the rutile-IrO2 phase,
while for IrO3 (a much less explored stoicheometry) we found several polymorphs phases that are predicted to be stable under OER conditions.
%
Finally, we conducted a throurough electrochemical analysis on the OER activity and stability of select IrO2 and discovered IrO3 phases and demonstrated enhanced electrochemical activity of IrO3 relative to IrO2 due to the higher oxidation state of the Ir atoms.
