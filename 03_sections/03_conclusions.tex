In conclusion, we have demonstrated an active-learning accelerated algorithm for the discovery of stable crystal polymorphs by searching through a candidate space of structurally distinct iridium-oxide phases.
% TODO Can I generalize this result for both IrO2 and IrO3?
% TODO Use percentage of total systems instead of just # of DFT calcs
The algorithm can identify 7 of the 10 most stable polymorphs of IrO3 with only 35 DFT bulk relaxations and TEMP of the most 10 stable IrO2 polymorphs after TEMP DFT calculations.

For IrO2, we find....  For IrO3 we find....
% Implications for for future studies of polymorphs
In the IrO2 space our search failed to uncover anything more stable than the rutile-IrO2 phase,
while for IrO3 (a much less explored stoicheometry) we found several polymorphs phases that are predicted to be stable under OER conditions.
% Describe the level of acceleration achieved, effect of structural drift, implications for future studies
We have analyzed the local and global structural coordination and revealed a large degree of structural diversity in our dataset (octahedral, tetrahedral, square-pyramidal, cubic, and square-planar)
% Discuss the difrencess  connectivity/M-O bonds leghts is diffrent beween IrO2 and IrO3
Although octahedral coordinations are energetically preferred TEMP TEMP.
%
The most stable systems were used to construct a revised Pourbaix diagram of Ir-H$_2$O system.
%
Very importantly, we predict that IrO3 is the thermodynamically preferred phase under OER conditions.
%
Finally, using thermodynamical approach to OER, we show,
that surfaces of selected IrO3 have much higher relative activity that IrO2 due to presence of high valency Ir[6+] states.
%
The 100 percent corner-sharing octahedral structures feature maximum coverage of oxygens with optimal $2p$-energy.
%
The OER results has broader implications for related OER systems.
%
Overall, the AL ML has tremendous potential for discovery of structurally diverse systems particularly where the known diversity is currently very small (Highly oxidized oxides).
%
Because our method provides readily available structural information which a necessary input for any characterization/simulation analysis TEMP We envision that .....
%
This opens up and new avenues of the materials/catalysis research with tailored structural properties.
