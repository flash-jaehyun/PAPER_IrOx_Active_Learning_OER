In conclusion, we have demonstrated an active-learning accelerated algorithm for the discovery of stable crystal polymorphs by searching through a candidate space of structurally distinct iridium-oxide phases.
% TODO Can I generalize this result for both IrO2 and IrO3?
% TODO Use percentage of total systems instead of just # of DFT calcs
The algorithm can identify {\bf half of the 10 percent ??? what is this} most stable polymorphs with only {\bf XX} DFT calculations. For IrO2, we find....  For IrO3 we find.... 
In the IrO2 space our search failed to uncover anything more stable than the rutile-IrO2 phase,
while for IrO3 (a much less explored stoicheometry) we found several polymorphs phases that are predicted to be stable under OER conditions.{\bf implications for for future studies of polymorphs}

{\bf Describe the level of acceleration achieved, effect of structural drift, implications for future studies}
We have analyzed the local and global structural coordination and revealed a large degree of structural diversity in our dataset (octahedral, tetrahedral, square-pyramidal, cubic, and square-planar )  
although octahedral coordinations are energetically preferred. Discuss the difrencess  connectivity/M-O bonds leghts is diffrent beween IrO2 and IrO3. 
The most stable systems are used to construct a revised Pourbaix diagram of Ir-H$_2$O system. Very importantly, we predict that IrO3 is the thermodynamically prefered phase under OER conditions. Finally, using thermodynamical approach to OER, we show, 
that surfaces of selected IrO3 have much higher relative activity that IrO2 due to presence of high Ir[6+] oxidation state. The 100 percent corner-sharing octahedral structures feature maximum coverage of oxygens with optimal $2p$-energy. The OER results has broasder impications for relaletd OER systems.

Overall, the AL ML has tremendous potential for discovery of structurally diverse systems particularly where the known diversity is curretly very small (Highly oxideized oxides). Because our method provides readily available structural information which a necessary input for any characterization/simulation analysis
We envision that ..... 
This opens up and new avenues of the materials/catalysis research with taylored structural properties.
