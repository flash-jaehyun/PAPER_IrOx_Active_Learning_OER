abstract = {Oxygen electrochemistry plays a key role in renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limit the performance and commercialization of such devices. Here we report an iridium oxide/strontium iridium oxide (IrOx/SrIrO3) catalyst formed during electrochemical testing by strontium leaching from surface layers of thin films of SrIrO3. This catalyst has demonstrated specific activity at 10 milliamps per square centimeter of oxide catalyst (OER current normalized to catalyst surface area), with only 270 to 290 millivolts of overpotential for 30 hours of continuous testing in acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of highly active surface layers during strontium leaching with IrO3 or anatase IrO2 motifs. The IrOx/SrIrO3 catalyst outperforms known IrOx and ruthenium oxide (RuOx) systems, the only other OER catalysts that have reasonable activity in acidic electrolyte.},

abstract = {The activities of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on iridium-oxide- and ruthenium-oxide-based catalysts are among the highest known to date. However, the OER activities of thermodynamically stable rutile iridium oxide (r-IrO2) and rutile iridium oxide (r-RuO2), normalized to catalyst mass or true surface area are not well-defined. Here we report a synthesis of r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of ∼6 nm, and examine their OER activities in acid and alkaline solutions. Both r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 NPs were highly active for OER, with r-RuO2 exhibiting up to 10 A/goxide at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. When comparing the two, r-RuO2 NPs were found to have slightly higher intrinsic and mass OER activities than r-IrO2 in both acid and basic solutions. Interestingly, these oxide NPs showed higher stability under OER conditions than commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts. Our study shows that these r-RuO2 and r-IrO2 NPs can serve as a benchmark in the development of active OER catalysts for electrol...},

abstract = {Objective comparisons of electrocatalyst activity and stability using standard methods under identical conditions are necessary to evaluate the viability of existing electrocatalysts for integration into solar-fuel devices as well as to help inform the development of new catalytic systems. Herein, we use a standard protocol as a primary screen for evaluating the activity, short-term (2 h) stability, and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 18 electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 26 electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under conditions relevant to an integrated solar water-splitting device in aqueous acidic or alkaline solution. Our primary figure of merit is the overpotential necessary to achieve a magnitude current density of 10 mA cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} per geometric area, the approximate current density expected for a 10{\%} efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device under 1 sun illumination. The specific activity per ECSA of each material is also reported. Among HER catalysts, several could operate at 10 mA cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} with overpotentials {\textless}0.1 V in acidic and/or alkaline solutions. Among OER catalysts in acidic solution, no non-noble metal based materials showed promising activity and stability, whereas in alkaline solution many OER catalysts performed with similar activity achieving 10 mA cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} current densities at overpotentials of ∼0.33-0.5 V. Most OER catalysts showed comparable or better specific activity per ECSA when compared to Ir and Ru catalysts in alkaline solutions, while most HER catalysts showed much lower specific activity than Pt in both acidic and alkaline solutions. For select catalysts, additional secondary screening measurements were conducted including Faradaic efficiency and extended stability measurements. (Graph Presented)},

abstract = {Water oxidation is a critical step in water splitting to make hydrogen fuel. We report the solution synthesis, structural/compositional characterization, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic properties of ∼2-3 nm thick films of NiOx, CoOx, NiyCo1-yOx, Ni0.9Fe 0.1Ox, IrOx, MnOx, and FeO x. The thin-film geometry enables the use of quartz crystal microgravimetry, voltammetry, and steady-state Tafel measurements to study the electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical properties of the oxides. Ni 0.9Fe0.1Ox was found to be the most active water oxidation catalyst in basic media, passing 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 336 mV with a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec-1 with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity roughly an order of magnitude higher than IrOx control films and similar to the best known OER catalysts in basic media. The high activity is attributed to the in situ formation of layered Ni0.9Fe0.1OOH oxyhydroxide species with nearly every Ni atom electrochemically active. In contrast to previous reports that showed synergy between Co and Ni oxides for OER catalysis, NiyCo 1-yOx thin films showed decreasing activity relative to the pure NiOx films with increasing Co content. This finding is explained by the suppressed in situ formation of the active layered oxyhydroxide with increasing Co. The high OER activity and simple synthesis make these Ni-based catalyst thin films useful for incorporating with semiconductor photoelectrodes for direct solar-driven water splitting or in high-surface-area electrodes for water electrolysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In the present study, we used a surface-science approach to establish a functional link between activity and stability of monometallic oxides during the OER in acidic media. We found that the most active oxides (Au ≪ Pt {\textless} Ir {\textless} Ru ≪ Os) are, in fact, the least stable (Au ≫ Pt {\textgreater} Ir {\textgreater} Ru ≫ Os) materials. We suggest that the relationships between stability and activity are controlled by both the nobility of oxides as well as by the density of surface defects. This functionality is governed by the nature of metal cations and the potential transformation of a stable metal cation with a valence state of n = +4 to unstable metal cation with n {\textgreater} +4. A practical consequence of such a close relationship between activity and stability is that the best materials for the OER should balance stability and activity in such a way that the dissolution rate is neither too fast nor too slow. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Hydrogen is often considered the best means by which to store energy coming from renewable and intermittent power sources. With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.},

abstract = {Kinetic parametes were determined for the oxygen evolution reaction on 50–50 atom percent alloys of RuIr, RuPt, and IrPt and compared with results obtained using ruthenium, iridium, platinum, and RuO2/TiO2 electrodes. The potentiostatic studies were made on oxide covered electrodes at 80°C in both 1.0 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M CF3SO3H. Cyclic voltammetric studies showed that while these noble metals and alloys are about equally effective as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, striking differences in activity are found for the oxygen evolution reaction. The order of electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution in H2SO4 is Ru {\textgreater} RuIr alloy ∼ RuO2/TiO2 ∼ Ir {\textgreater} IrPt alloy {\textgreater} RuPt alloy {\textgreater} Pt. The type of acid used had very little effect on the kinetic parameters. The lower electrocatalytic activities when platinum is present is probably due to the formation of a platinum oxide film. The dual barrier model is used to interpret the results for the electrodes containing platinum. The best electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution in acid solutions consist of noble metals which form oxide films (RuO2, IrO2) possessing metallic characteristics.},

abstract = {Lithium-ion battery cathode materials have relied on cationic redox reactions until the recent discovery of anionic redox activity in Li-rich layered compounds which enables capacities as high as 300 mAh g-1. In the quest for new high-capacity electrodes with anionic redox, a still unanswered question was remaining regarding the importance of the structural dimensionality. The present manuscript provides an answer. We herein report on a $\beta$-Li2IrO3 phase which, in spite of having the Ir arranged in a tridimensional (3D) framework instead of the typical two-dimensional (2D) layers seen in other Li-rich oxides, can reversibly exchange 2.5 e- per Ir, the highest value ever reported for any insertion reaction involving d-metals. We show that such a large activity results from joint reversible cationic (Mn+) and anionic (O2)n- redox processes, the latter being visualized via complementary transmission electron microscopy and neutron diffraction experiments, and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, $\beta$-Li2IrO3 presents a good cycling behaviour while showing neither cationic migration nor shearing of atomic layers as seen in 2D-layered Li-rich materials. Remarkably, the anionic redox process occurs jointly with the oxidation of Ir4+ at potentials as low as 3.4 V versus Li+/Li0, as equivalently observed in the layered $\alpha$-Li2IrO3 polymorph. Theoretical calculations elucidate the electrochemical similarities and differences of the 3D versus 2D polymorphs in terms of structural, electronic and mechanical descriptors. Our findings free the structural dimensionality constraint and broaden the possibilities in designing high-energy-density electrodes for the next generation of Li-ion batteries.},

abstract = {Multimetallic Ir-based systems offer significant opportunities for enhanced oxygen evolution electrocatalysis by modifying the electronic and geometric properties of the active catalyst. Herein, a systematic investigation of bimetallic Ir-based thin films was performed to identify activity and stability trends across material systems for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media. Electron beam evaporation was used to co-deposit metallic films of Ir, IrSn2, IrCr, IrTi, and IrNi. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrochemically oxidized alloys was found to increase in the following order: IrTi {\textless} IrSn2 {\textless} Ir ∼IrNi {\textless} IrCr. The IrCr system demonstrates two times the catalytic activity of Ir at 1.65 V versus RHE. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this enhancement is due to Cr active sites that have improved oxygen binding energetics compared to those of pure Ir oxide. This work identifies IrCr as a promising new catalyst system that facilitates reduced precious metal loadings for acid-based OER catalysis.},
