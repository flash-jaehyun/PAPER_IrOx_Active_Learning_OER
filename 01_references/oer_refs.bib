abstract = {Trends in electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are investigated on the basis of a large database of HO* and HOO* adsorption energies on oxide surfaces. The theoretical overpotential was calculated by applying standard density functional theory in combination with the computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) model. We showed that by the discovery of a universal scaling relation between the adsorption energies of HOO* vs HO*, it is possible to analyze the reaction free energy diagrams of all the oxides in a general way. This gave rise to an activity volcano that was the same for a wide variety of oxide catalyst materials and a universal descriptor for the oxygen evolution activity, which suggests a fundamental limitation on the maximum oxygen evolution activity of planar oxide catalysts.},

We used that method in combination with detailed density functional calculations to develop a detailed description of the free-energy landscape of the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction over Pt(111) as a function of applied bias. This allowed us to identify the origin of the overpotential found for this reaction. Adsorbed oxygen and hydroxyl are found to be very stable intermediates at potentials close to equilibrium, and the calculated rate constant for the activated proton/electron transfer to adsorbed oxygen or hydroxyl can account quantitatively for the observed kinetics. On the basis of a database of calculated oxygen and hydroxyl adsorption energies, the trends in the oxygen reduction rate for a large number of different transition and noble metals can be accounted for. Alternative reaction mechanisms involving proton/electron transfer to adsorbed molecular oxygen were also considered, and this peroxide mechanism was found to dominate for the most noble metals.

abstract = {The presence of layered cobalt oxides has been identified experimentally in Co-based anodes under oxygen-evolving conditions. In this work, we report the results of theoretical investigations of the relative stability of layered and spinel bulk phases of Co oxides, as well as the stability of selected surfaces as a function of applied potential and pH. We then study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on these surfaces and obtain activity trends at experimentally relevant electro-chemical conditions. Our calculated volume Pourbaix diagram shows that $\beta$-CoOOH is the active phase where the OER occurs in alkaline media. We calculate relative surface stabilities and adsorbate coverages of the most stable low-index surfaces of $\beta$-CoOOH: (0001), (011{\`{I}}..2), and (101{\`{I}}..4). We find that at low applied potentials, the (101{\`{I}}..4) surface is the most stable, while the (011{\`{I}}..2) surface is the more stable at higher potentials. Next, we compare the theoretical overpotentials for all three surfaces and find that the (101{\`{I}}..4) surface is the most active one as characterized by an overpotential of $\eta$ = 0.48 V. The high activity of the (101{\`{I}}..4) surface can be attributed to the observation that the resting state of Co in the active site is Co3+ during the OER, whereas Co is in the Co4+ state in the less active surfaces. Lastly, we demonstrate that the overpotential of the (101{\`{I}}..4) surface can be lowered further by surface substitution of Co by Ni. This finding could explain the experimentally observed enhancement in the OER activity of Ni yCo1-yOx thin films with increasing Ni content. All energetics in this work were obtained from density functional theory using the Hubbard-U correction. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Herein, we study the active surfaces of layered lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using the enhancement effect of electrochemical delithiation (De-LCO). Our theoretical results indicate that the most stable (0001) surface has a very large overpotential for OER independent of lithium content. In contrast, edge sites such as the nonpolar (112̅0) and polar (011̅2) surfaces are predicted to be highly active and dependent on (de)lithiation. The effect of lithium extraction from LCO on the surfaces and their OER activities can be understood by the increase of Co4+ sites relative to Co3+ and by the shift of active oxygen 2p states. Experimentally, it is demonstrated that LCO nanosheets, which dominantly expose the (0001) surface show negligible OER enhancement upon delithiation. However, a noticeable increase in OER activity (∼0.1 V in overpotential shift at 10 mA cm-2) is observed for the LCO nanoparticles, where the basal plane is greatly diminished to expose the edge sites, consistent with the theoretical simulations. Additionally, we find that the OER activity of De-LCO nanosheets can be improved if we adopt an acid etching method on LCO to create more active edge sites, which in turn provides a strong evidence for the theoretical indication.},

abstract = {Developing active and stable oxygen evolution catalysts is a key to enabling various future energy technologies, and the state of the art catalysts are Ir-containing oxide materials. Understanding oxygen chemistry on oxide materials is significantly more complicated than studying transition-metal catalysts for two reasons: the most stable surface coverage under reaction conditions is extremely important but difficult to understand without many detailed calculations, and there are many possible active sites and configurations on O*- or OH*-covered surfaces. We have developed an automated and high-throughput approach to solve this problem and predict OER overpotentials for arbitrary oxide surfaces. We demonstrate this for a number of previously unstudied IrO2 and IrO3 polymorphs and their facets. We discovered that low-index surfaces of IrO2 other than rutile (110) are more active than the most stable rutile (110), and we identified promising active sites of IrO2 and IrO3 that outperform rutile (110) by 0.2 V in theoretical overpotential. On the basis of findings from DFT calculations, we provide catalyst design strategies to improve the catalytic activity of Ir-based catalysts and demonstrate a machine learning model capable of predicting surface coverages and site activity. This work highlights the importance of investigating unexplored chemical space to design promising catalysts.},

abstract = {Density functional theory calculations are potentially useful for both understanding the activity of experimentally tested catalysts and screening for new catalyst materials. For electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, these analyses are usually performed considering only the thermodynamics of the reaction path, which typically consists of adsorbed OH*, O*, and OOH*. Scaling relationships between the stability of these intermediates lead to a limiting potential volcano whose optimum is constrained by the roughly constant offset between the binding energies of OH∗ and OOH*. In this work, we evaluate OER kinetics at rutile IrO2, RuO2, RhO2, and PtO2 surfaces by computing reaction barriers with an explicit model of the electrochemical interface. We conclude that the kinetics of proton transfer between oxygen atoms at the surface and in the electrolyte is facile and that O-O bond formation is most likely rate-determining in all cases. Combining these results with a microkinetic model and a scaling relationship for the OOH∗ formation barrier, we construct a new activity volcano whose optimum is similar to that of the limiting potential volcano for typical current densities. This kinetic volcano is also shown to agree reasonably well with experimental observations. Based on this analysis, we propose a more precise requirement for improving OER catalysts beyond the state of the art: The transition state for OOH∗ formation must be stabilized as opposed to the fully formed OOH∗ final state as has been previously presumed.},

abstract = {A catalyst functions by stabilizing reaction intermediates, usually through surface adsorption. In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surface oxygen adsorption plays an indispensable role in the electrocatalysis. The relationship between the adsorption energetics and OER kinetics, however, has not yet been experimentally measured. Herein we report an experimental relationship between the adsorption of surface oxygen and the kinetics of the OER on IrO2(110) epitaxially grown on a TiO2(110) single crystal. The high quality of the IrO2 film grown using molecular-beam epitaxy affords the ability to extract the surface oxygen adsorption and its impact on the OER. By examining a series of electrolytes, we find that the adsorption energy changes linearly with pH, which we attribute to the electrified interfacial water. We support this hypothesis by showing that an electrolyte salt modification can lead to an adsorption energy shift. The dependence of the adsorption energy on pH has implications for the OER kinetics, but it is not the only factor; the dependence of the OER electrocatalysis on pH stipulates two OER mechanisms, one operating in acidic solution and another operating in alkaline solution. Our work points to the subtle adsorption-kinetics relationship in the OER and highlights the importance of the interfacial electrified interaction in electrocatalyst design.},

Herein, we identify a relationship between the atom-projected density of states of surface oxygen and its ability to make and break bonds with the surrounding metal atoms and hydrogen. This structure-property relationship is shown to hold across different classes of materials (metals, rutile metal-oxides, and perovskite metal-oxides) and for different oxygen binding sites (i.e. different oxygen coordination numbers). We utilize understanding from the d-band model and the simple two-level quantum coupling problem to shed light on the physical origin of this relationship for transition metal surfaces and we hypothesize similar principles extend to the other materials considered. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the identified descriptor to serve as a tool for high throughput screening of oxygen active sites for large systems where many unique oxygen sites exist and can be computationally expensive to probe individually. As an example, we predict the reactivity of 36 unique oxygen atoms at a kinked RuO2 extended surface from a single self-consistent DFT calculation.},
