We find the set of surfaces contained in the equilibrium shape to be depending on environment. The(0001)and (10 (1) over bar4) surfaces are present for all reasonable values of the Li and O chemical potentials. The (01 (1) over bar2) surface, however, is stable only under oxidizing conditions. The equilibrium shape is sensitive to the equilibration environment because the thermodynamically favorable surface terminations and surface energies of the polar (0001) and (01 (1) over bar2) surfaces are a function of environment. This provides a lever to tailor the crystal shape according to application requirements (e.g., as active material in lithium-ion batteries).},

A promising idea to manage and simplify the con¯guration process is based on the premise of using reference models for this task. Our paper continues along this idea and delivers a two-fold contribution: ¯rst, we present a generic process for the task of model-driven Enterprise Systems con¯guration including the steps of (a) Speci¯cation of con¯gurable reference models, (b) Con¯guration of con¯gurable reference models, (c) Transformation of con¯gured reference models to regular build time models, (d) Deployment of the generated build time models, (e) Controlling of implementation models to provide input to the con¯guration, and (f) Consolidation of implementation models to provide input to reference model speci¯cation. We discuss inputs and outputs as well as the involvement of di{\textregistered}erent roles and validation mechanisms. Second, we present an instantiation case of this generic process for Enterprise Systems con¯guration based on Con¯gurable EPCs.},

abstract = {We present a systematic theoretical investigation of the surface properties, stability and reactivity, of rock-salt type alkaline-earth metal oxides including MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO. The accuracy of commonly used exchange-correlation density functionals (LDA, PBE, RPBE, PBEsol, BEEF-vdW and hybrid HSE) and random-phase approximation (RPA) is evaluated and compared to existing experimental values. Calculated surface energies of the four most stable surface facets under vacuum conditions: the (100) surface, the metal and oxygen terminated octopolar (111), and the (110) surfaces exhibit a monotonic increase in stability from MgO to BaO. On the MgO(100) surface, adsorption of CO, NO, CH4 is characterized by physisorption while H2O chemisorbs, which is in agreement with experimental findings. We further use the on-top metal adsorption of CO and NO molecules to map out the surface energetics of each alkaline-earth metal oxide surface. The considered functionals all qualitatively predict similar adsorption energy trends. The ordering between the adsorption energies on different surface facets can be attributed to differences in the local geometrical surface structure and the electronic structure of the metal constituent of the alkaline-earth metal oxide. The striking observation that CO adsorption strength is weaker than NO adsorption on the (100) terraces as the period of the alkaline-earth metal in the oxide increases, is analyzed in detail in terms of charge redistribution within the {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} and {\{}$\backslash$pi{\}} channels of adsorbates. Finally, we also present oxygen adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation energies in these oxide systems.},

abstract = {IrO 2 is a key material for photocatalytic applications as water oxidation catalyst. Despite its increasing interest, little is known about its molecular structure and reactivity. In this study, the surface properties of stoichiometric rutile IrO 2 are investigated by means of periodic density functional theory (DFT), including the structural, energetic, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity toward catechol, a probe molecule mimicking photocatalytic linkers. Our results show that the (110)-IrO 2 rutile termination is the most stable, and we discuss the role of the number and type of surface sites in the relative stability compared with (100), (001), and (101) terminations. Regarding the reactivity of the surfaces with catechol, our results show that the molecule dissociates and binds in bidentate, chelate, and monodentate modes. Interestingly, we find the chelated mode selectively favored over the (001) termination with the highest adsorption energy, −3.93 eV, being unstable on other terminations. The bidentate mode is preferred on (110) −3.83 eV, (100) −3.24 eV, and (101) −2.23 eV. The selective stabilization of the chelated mode, suggested in the literature to be responsible for the optical absorption in TiO 2 nanoparticles, could guide in the search of tailored iridia-based interfaces for photocatalytic applications.},
