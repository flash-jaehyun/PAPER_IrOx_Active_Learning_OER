abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a ubiquitous technique for data analysis and processing, but one which is not based on a probability model. We demonstrate how the principal axes of a set of observed data vectors may be determined through maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in a latent variable model that is closely related to factor analysis. We consider the properties of the associated likelihood function, giving an EM algorithm for estimating the principal subspace iteratively, and discuss, with illustrative examples, the advantages conveyed by this probabilistic approach to PCA.},

abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li 4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Coordination or local environments (e.g., tetrahedra and octahedra) are powerful descriptors of the crystalline structure of materials. These structural descriptors are essential to the understanding of crystal chemistry and the design of new materials. However, extensive statistics on the occurence of local environment are not available even on common chemistries such as oxides. Here, we present the first large-scale statistical analysis of the coordination environments of cations in oxides using a large set of experimentally observed compounds (about 8,000). Using a newly developed method, we provide the distribution of local environment for each cation in oxides. We discuss our results highlighting previously know trends, unexpected coordination environments as well as compounds presenting very rare coordinations. Our work complements the know-how of the solid state chemist with a statistically sound analysis and pave the way for further data mining efforts linking for instance coordination environment...},

abstract = {The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) is a high-throughput database currently consisting of nearly 300,000 density functional theory (DFT) total energy calculations of compounds from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and decorations of commonly occurring crystal structures. To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of {\~{}}3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.},

# Chuanxun_Su Paper for CCF and also crystal structure database
@article{Su2017,
abstract = {Crystal structure prototype data have become a useful source of information for materials discovery in the fields of crystallography, chemistry, physics, and materials science. This work reports the development of a robust and efficient method for assessing the similarity of structures on the basis of their interatomic distances. Using this method, we proposed a simple and unambiguous definition of crystal structure prototype based on hierarchical clustering theory, and constructed the crystal structure prototype database (CSPD) by filtering the known crystallographic structures in a database. With similar method, a program structure prototype analysis package (SPAP) was developed to remove similar structures in CALYPSO prediction results and extract predicted low energy structures for a separate theoretical structure database. A series of statistics describing the distribution of crystal structure prototypes in the CSPD was compiled to provide an important insight for structure prediction and high-throughput calculations. Illustrative examples of the application of the proposed database are given, including the generation of initial structures for structure prediction and determination of the prototype structure in databases. These examples demonstrate the CSPD to be a generally applicable and useful tool for materials discovery.},

Simple plausibility arguments have been advanced previously suggesting that at fixed positive density the number of distinguishable inherent structures rises exponentially with system size. A more systematic analysis is presented here, using lower and upper bounds, that leads to the same conclusion. Further examination reveals that the characteristic exponential rise rate for inherent structure enumeration diverges as the density approaches zero, when attractive interparticle forces are present. {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Aykol2018,
abstract = {Realizing the growing number of possible or hypothesized metastable crystalline materials is extremely challenging. There is no rigorous metric to identify which compounds can or cannot be synthesized. We present a thermodynamic upper limit on the energy scale, above which the laboratory synthesis of a polymorph is highly unlikely. The limit is defined on the basis of the amorphous state, and we validate its utility by effectively classifying more than 700 polymorphs in 41 common inorganic material systems in the Materials Project for synthesizability. The amorphous limit is highly chemistry-dependent and is found to be in complete agreement with our knowledge of existing polymorphs in these 41 systems, whether made by the nature or in a laboratory. Quantifying the limits of metastability for realizable compounds, the approach is expected to find major applications in materials discovery.},

@article{Wigner1933,
abstract = {Previous developments in the theory of metals may be divided clearly into two parts: that based principally upon the hypothesis of free electrons and dealing with conductivity properties, and that based upon calculations of valence forces and dealing with the chemical properties. In the present article an intermediate point of view is adopted and the free-electron picture is employed in an investigation of chemical properties of metallic sodium. The assumption is made that in the metal the K and L shells of an atom are not altered from their form in the free atom. The properties of the wave functions of the electrons are discussed qualitatively, first of all, and it is concluded that the binding energy will be positive even when the Pauli principle is taken account of. This is followed by a quantitative investigation of the energy to be associated with the lowest state. First of all it is shown to what extent the present picture takes account of the interactions of electrons with both parallel and antiparallel spins, and to what extent remaining effects may be neglected. Next a Schroedinger equation is solved in order to determine the lowest energy level for various values of the lattice constant. To this a correction is made to account for the Pauli principle and from the result the lattice constant, binding energy and compressibility are calculated with favorable results. {\textcopyright} 1933 The American Physical Society.},
