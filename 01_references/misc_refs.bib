abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a ubiquitous technique for data analysis and processing, but one which is not based on a probability model. We demonstrate how the principal axes of a set of observed data vectors may be determined through maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in a latent variable model that is closely related to factor analysis. We consider the properties of the associated likelihood function, giving an EM algorithm for estimating the principal subspace iteratively, and discuss, with illustrative examples, the advantages conveyed by this probabilistic approach to PCA.},

@article{Ong2013,
abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li 4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Waroquiers2017,
abstract = {Coordination or local environments (e.g., tetrahedra and octahedra) are powerful descriptors of the crystalline structure of materials. These structural descriptors are essential to the understanding of crystal chemistry and the design of new materials. However, extensive statistics on the occurence of local environment are not available even on common chemistries such as oxides. Here, we present the first large-scale statistical analysis of the coordination environments of cations in oxides using a large set of experimentally observed compounds (about 8,000). Using a newly developed method, we provide the distribution of local environment for each cation in oxides. We discuss our results highlighting previously know trends, unexpected coordination environments as well as compounds presenting very rare coordinations. Our work complements the know-how of the solid state chemist with a statistically sound analysis and pave the way for further data mining efforts linking for instance coordination environment...},
