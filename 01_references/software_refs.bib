abstract = {In recent years, ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) techniques have made a profound impact on the investigation of the structure of the electronic and dynamic properties of liquid and amorphous materials. In this paper, recent developments in this field are reviewed and it is shown that the exact calculation of the electronic groundstate at each MD timestep is feasible using modern iterative matrix diagonalization algorithms. Together with the use of ultrasoft pseudopotentials, ab initio MD simulations can be extended to open-shell transition metals with a high density of states at the Fermi-level. The technique is applied to a number of interesting cases: (a) liquid simple metals (Li, Na, Al, Ge), (b) liquid transition metals (Cu, V), and (c) the transition from a liquid metal to an amorphous semiconductor by the rapid quenching of Ge. {\textcopyright} 1995, All rights reserved.},

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Konn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order N2atoms scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special 'preconditioning' optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order (Formula presented) operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special “metric” and a special “preconditioning” optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order (Formula presented) scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach (Formula presented). We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

# Justification for dipole-corrections
@article{Neugebauer1992,
abstract = {We present total-energy, force, and electronic-structure calculations for Na and K adsorbed in various geometries on an Al(111) surface. The calculations apply density-functional theory together with the local-density approximation and the ab initio pseudopotential formalism. Two adsorbate meshes, namely, (3 × 3) R30°and (2×2), are considered and for each of them the geometry of the adlayer relative to the substrate is varied over a wide range of possibilities. By total-energy minimization we determine stable and metastable geometries. For Na we find for both adsorbate meshes that the ordering of the calculated binding energies per adatom is such that the substitutional geometry, where each Na atom replaces a surface Al atom, is most favorable and the on-top position is most unfavorable. The (3 × 3) R30°structure has a lower energy than the (2×2) structure. This is shown to be a substrate effect and not an effect of the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction. In contrast to the results for Na, we find for the (3 × 3) R30°K adsorption that the calculated adsorption energies for the on-top, threefold hollow, and substitutional sites are equal within the accuracy of our calculation, which is 0.03 eV. The similarity of the energies of the on-surface adsorption sites is explained as a consequence of the bigger size of K which implies that the adatom experiences a rather small substrate electron-density corrugation. Therefore for potassium the on-top and hollow sites are close in energy already for the unrelaxed Al(111) substrate. Because the relaxation energy of the on-top site is larger than that of the threefold hollow site both sites receive practically the same adsorption energy. The unexpected possibility of surface-substitutional sites is explained as a consequence of the ionic nature of the bonding which, at higher coverages, can develop strongest when the adatom can dive into the substrate as deep as possible. The interesting result of the studied systems is that the difference in bond strengths between the normal and substitutional geometries is sufficiently large to kick out a surface Al atom. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},
