The(0001)and (10 (1) over bar4) surfaces are present for all reasonable values of the Li and O chemical potentials. The (01 (1) over bar2) surface, however, is stable only under oxidizing conditions. The equilibrium shape is sensitive to the equilibration environment because the thermodynamically favorable surface terminations and surface energies of the polar (0001) and (01 (1) over bar2) surfaces are a function of environment. This provides a lever to tailor the crystal shape according to application requirements (e.g., as active material in lithium-ion batteries).},

abstract = {Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations have been combined with a thermodynamic formalism to determine a phase diagram of lowest-energy structures and compositions of the polar NiO(111) surface in equilibirum with oxygen, hydrogen, and water reservoirs at finite temperatures and pressures. Consistent with experiment we find that for a wide range of oxygen and hydrogen chemical potentials the surface is fully hydroxylated and shows a (1×1) periodicity. At higher temperatures and H-poor conditions water can be removed from the surface and the two (2×2) octopolar reconstructions become the thermodynamically most stable configurations. Other structures, which have been proposed on the basis of experimental data after high-temperature annealing, have to be considered to be kinetically limited metastable phases. In O-poor conditions no reduced surface structures are found to be thermodynamically stable. However, in O-rich environments and at low hydrogen chemical potential the surface can be oxidized by a partial removal of hydrogen or incorporation of additional oxygen. The structural motifs are closely related to the cadmium iodide structure of Ni(OH) 2  and NiO 2 . {\textcopyright} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  {\&}  Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract = {Based on density functional theory calculations we investigate the electrochemically most stable surface structures as a function of pH and electrostatic potential for Pt(111), Ag(111) and Ni(111), and we construct surface Pourbaix diagrams. We study the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the different surface structures and calculate the free energy of the intermediates. We estimate their catalytic activity for ORR by determining the highest potential at which all ORR reaction steps reduce the free energy. We obtain self-consistency in the sense that the surface is stable under the potential at which that particular surface can perform ORR. Using the self consistent surfaces, the activity of the very reactive Ni surface changes dramatically, whereas the activity of the more noble catalysts Pt and Ag remains unchanged. The reason for this difference is the oxidation of the reactive surface. Oxygen absorbed on the surface shifts the reactivity towards the weak binding region, which in turn increases the activity. The oxidation state of the surface and the ORR potential are constant versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The dissolution potential in acidic solution, on the other hand, is constant vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). For Ag, this means that where the potential for dissolution and ORR are about the same at pH = 0, Ag becomes more stable relative to RHE as pH is increased. Hence the pH dependent stability offers an explanation for the possible use of Ag in alkaline fuel cell cathodes.},

abstract = {The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) is a high-throughput database currently consisting of nearly 300,000 density functional theory (DFT) total energy calculations of compounds from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and decorations of commonly occurring crystal structures. To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of {\~{}}3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.},

Here we report a synthesis of r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of ∼6 nm, and examine their OER activities in acid and alkaline solutions. Both r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 NPs were highly active for OER, with r-RuO2 exhibiting up to 10 A/goxide at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. When comparing the two, r-RuO2 NPs were found to have slightly higher intrinsic and mass OER activities than r-IrO2 in both acid and basic solutions. Interestingly, these oxide NPs showed higher stability under OER conditions than commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts. Our study shows that these r-RuO2 and r-IrO2 NPs can serve as a benchmark in the development of active OER catalysts for electrol...},

abstract = {Surface energies of several low-index surfaces of layered LiCoO2 are investigated as a function of the external lithium and oxygen chemical potentials by means of First Principles calculations in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to density functional theory (DFT), treating on-site electron correlation within the DFT+U framework. We find the set of surfaces contained in the equilibrium shape to be depending on environment. The(0001)and (10 (1) over bar4) surfaces are present for all reasonable values of the Li and O chemical potentials. The (01 (1) over bar2) surface, however, is stable only under oxidizing conditions. The equilibrium shape is sensitive to the equilibration environment because the thermodynamically favorable surface terminations and surface energies of the polar (0001) and (01 (1) over bar2) surfaces are a function of environment. This provides a lever to tailor the crystal shape according to application requirements (e.g., as active material in lithium-ion batteries).},

abstract = {Enterprise Systems potentially lead to signi¯cant e±ciency gains but require a well-conducted con¯guration process. A promising idea to manage and simplify the con¯guration process is based on the premise of using reference models for this task. Our paper continues along this idea and delivers a two-fold contribution: ¯rst, we present a generic process for the task of model-driven Enterprise Systems con¯guration including the steps of (a) Speci¯cation of con¯gurable reference models, (b) Con¯guration of con¯gurable reference models, (c) Transformation of con¯gured reference models to regular build time models, (d) Deployment of the generated build time models, (e) Controlling of implementation models to provide input to the con¯guration, and (f) Consolidation of implementation models to provide input to reference model speci¯cation. We discuss inputs and outputs as well as the involvement of di{\textregistered}erent roles and validation mechanisms. Second, we present an instantiation case of this generic process for Enterprise Systems con¯guration based on Con¯gurable EPCs.},

@article{Bajdich2015,
abstract = {We present a systematic theoretical investigation of the surface properties, stability and reactivity, of rock-salt type alkaline-earth metal oxides including MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO. The accuracy of commonly used exchange-correlation density functionals (LDA, PBE, RPBE, PBEsol, BEEF-vdW and hybrid HSE) and random-phase approximation (RPA) is evaluated and compared to existing experimental values. Calculated surface energies of the four most stable surface facets under vacuum conditions: the (100) surface, the metal and oxygen terminated octopolar (111), and the (110) surfaces exhibit a monotonic increase in stability from MgO to BaO. On the MgO(100) surface, adsorption of CO, NO, CH4 is characterized by physisorption while H2O chemisorbs, which is in agreement with experimental findings. We further use the on-top metal adsorption of CO and NO molecules to map out the surface energetics of each alkaline-earth metal oxide surface. The considered functionals all qualitatively predict similar adsorption energy trends. The ordering between the adsorption energies on different surface facets can be attributed to differences in the local geometrical surface structure and the electronic structure of the metal constituent of the alkaline-earth metal oxide. The striking observation that CO adsorption strength is weaker than NO adsorption on the (100) terraces as the period of the alkaline-earth metal in the oxide increases, is analyzed in detail in terms of charge redistribution within the {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} and {\{}$\backslash$pi{\}} channels of adsorbates. Finally, we also present oxygen adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation energies in these oxide systems.},

abstract = {IrO 2 is a key material for photocatalytic applications as water oxidation catalyst. Despite its increasing interest, little is known about its molecular structure and reactivity. In this study, the surface properties of stoichiometric rutile IrO 2 are investigated by means of periodic density functional theory (DFT), including the structural, energetic, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity toward catechol, a probe molecule mimicking photocatalytic linkers. Our results show that the (110)-IrO 2 rutile termination is the most stable, and we discuss the role of the number and type of surface sites in the relative stability compared with (100), (001), and (101) terminations. Regarding the reactivity of the surfaces with catechol, our results show that the molecule dissociates and binds in bidentate, chelate, and monodentate modes. Interestingly, we find the chelated mode selectively favored over the (001) termination with the highest adsorption energy, −3.93 eV, being unstable on other terminations. The bidentate mode is preferred on (110) −3.83 eV, (100) −3.24 eV, and (101) −2.23 eV. The selective stabilization of the chelated mode, suggested in the literature to be responsible for the optical absorption in TiO 2 nanoparticles, could guide in the search of tailored iridia-based interfaces for photocatalytic applications.},
