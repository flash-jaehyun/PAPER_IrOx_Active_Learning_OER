abstract = {Solving and predicting atomic structures from first-principles methodologies is limited by the computational cost of exploring the search space, even when relatively inexpensive density functionals are used. Here, we present an efficient approach where the search is performed using density functional tight-binding, with an automatic adaptive parametrization scheme for the repulsive pair potentials. We successfully apply the method to the genetic algorithm optimization of bulk carbon, titanium dioxide, palladium oxide, and calcium hydroxide, and we assess the stability of the unknown crystal structure of palladium hydroxide.},

abstract = {The ability to navigate vast energy landscapes of molecules, clusters, and solids is a necessity for discovering novel compounds in computational chemistry and materials science. For high-dimensional systems, it is only computationally feasible to search a small portion of the landscape, and hence, the search strategy is of critical importance. Introducing Bayesian optimization concepts in an evolutionary algorithm framework, we quantify the concepts of exploration and exploitation in global minimum searches. The method allows us to control the balance between probing unknown regions of the landscape (exploration) and investigating further regions of the landscape known to have low-energy structures (exploitation). The search for global minima structures proves significantly faster with the optimal balance for three test systems (molecular compounds) and to a lesser extent also for a crystalline surface reconstruction. In addition, global search behaviors are analyzed to provide reasonable grounds for an optimal balance for different problems.},

abstract = {The prediction of structure at the atomic level is one of the most fundamental challenges in condensed matter science. Here we survey the current status of the field and consider recent developments in methodology, paying particular attention to approaches for surveying energy landscapes. We illustrate the current state of the art in this field with topical applications to inorganic, especially microporous solids, and to molecular crystals; we also look at applications to nanoparticulate structures. Finally, we consider future directions and challenges in the field. {\textcopyright} 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},
