abstract = {Solving and predicting atomic structures from first-principles methodologies is limited by the computational cost of exploring the search space, even when relatively inexpensive density functionals are used. Here, we present an efficient approach where the search is performed using density functional tight-binding, with an automatic adaptive parametrization scheme for the repulsive pair potentials. We successfully apply the method to the genetic algorithm optimization of bulk carbon, titanium dioxide, palladium oxide, and calcium hydroxide, and we assess the stability of the unknown crystal structure of palladium hydroxide.},

abstract = {The ability to navigate vast energy landscapes of molecules, clusters, and solids is a necessity for discovering novel compounds in computational chemistry and materials science. For high-dimensional systems, it is only computationally feasible to search a small portion of the landscape, and hence, the search strategy is of critical importance. Introducing Bayesian optimization concepts in an evolutionary algorithm framework, we quantify the concepts of exploration and exploitation in global minimum searches. The method allows us to control the balance between probing unknown regions of the landscape (exploration) and investigating further regions of the landscape known to have low-energy structures (exploitation). The search for global minima structures proves significantly faster with the optimal balance for three test systems (molecular compounds) and to a lesser extent also for a crystalline surface reconstruction. In addition, global search behaviors are analyzed to provide reasonable grounds for an optimal balance for different problems.},

    abstract = {Evolutionary crystal structure prediction proved to be a powerful approach in discovering new materials. Certain limitations are encountered for systems with a large number of degrees of freedom ("large systems") and complex energy landscapes ("complex systems"). We explore the nature of these limitations and address them with a number of newly developed tools. For large systems a major problem is the lack of diversity: any randomly produced population consists predominantly of high-energy disordered structures, offering virtually no routes toward the ordered ground state. We offer two solutions: first, modified variation operators that favor atoms with higher local order (a function we introduce here), and, second, construction of the first generation non-randomly, using pseudo-subcells with, in general, fractional atomic occupancies. This enhances order and diversity and improves energies of the structures. We introduce an additional variation operator, coordinate mutation, which applies preferentially to low-order ("badly placed") atoms. Biasing other variation operators by local order is also found to produce improved results. One promising version of coordinate mutation, explored here, displaces atoms along the eigenvector of the lowest-frequency vibrational mode. For complex energy landscapes, the key problem is the possible existence of several energy funnels - in this situation it is possible to get trapped in one funnel (not necessarily containing the ground state). To address this problem, we develop an algorithm incorporating the ideas of abstract "distance" between structures. These new ingredients improve the performance of the evolutionary algorithm USPEX, in terms of efficiency and reliability, for large and complex systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

All of these techniques have been demonstrated to be critical to the prediction of global stable structure. We have implemented these techniques into the CALYPSO code.
