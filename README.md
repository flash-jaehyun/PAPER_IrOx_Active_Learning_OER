Proper workflow

1. From `Overleaf.com`: Sync changes in Overleaf to Github
  - Menu --> Github --> Push Overleaf changes to Github
2. From local repo:
  - Make sure all local changs are pushed to `raul_master`
3. From Github: Merge `raul_master` into `master`
4. From Github: Merge `master` into `king`
5. From Github: Merge `king` into `master` (NECESSARY?)
6. From `Overleaf.com`: Sync changes down from Github
