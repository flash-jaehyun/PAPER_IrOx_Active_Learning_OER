## TODO List:
  * Reference the Catlearn paper and codebase
  * Be consistent about use of 'fingerprint' vs 'feature', just use 1

## Notes:
### Code-folding syntax
I use a custom syntax to fold code through out this repo (% | - CF start) and (% \_\_|).
I find this quite useful for navigation, and to achieve the same effect in your VIM editor put the following code into your `~/vimrc`:

`setlocal foldmethod=marker foldmarker=#\|\ -,#__\|`



## Paper Tags:
  `#REF`
  `#TODO`
  `##COMBAK`

## Final Pre-submission Checklist
1. Make sure that all acronyms are defined before they are used
2. Make sure all references are placed correctly
3. Define Gaussian Process (GP) in text
4. Consistent formatting of V vs. RHE (with dot at vs.)
5. ab-initio is formatted properly (italicized)

## Git commands

Workflow (Just for @Raul)

1. From `Overleaf.com`: Sync changes in Overleaf to Github
  - Menu --> Github --> Push Overleaf changes to Github
2. From local repo:
  - Make sure all local changs are pushed to `raul_master`
3. From Github: Merge `raul_master` into `master`
4. From Github: Merge `master` into `king`
5. From Github: Merge `king` into `master` (NECESSARY?)
6. From `Overleaf.com`: Sync changes down from Github
